  *        will set the ball's x velocity to the inverse of what it currently *
  *        is set to and then change the y velocity depending on where it     *
  *        hits the platform at.  (higher to the top or the bottom will       *
  *        result in a higher magnitude)                                      *
  *                                                                           *

  *          xVeloc: ammount in x to move by                                  *

  *          Just a generic move method that will change an object's location *
  *          based on its velocity.                                           *

  *          Ball: the object to check if in bounds                           *

  *          Check to see if the ball is outside the edge of the playfield.   *
  *          If it hits an upper or lower bound the y velocity is inversed    *
  *          while if it hits a side edge it will reward a point to either the*
